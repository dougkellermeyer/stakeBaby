# Welcome to StakeBaby! 

## Input your computer's specs or choose a protocol to view your optimal staking setup.

### TODO
- Write match function to pull into user spec object and compare it to protocol specs.
  - Expected output of match function is to suggest optimal protocol (v1) 
  - (v2) would be to show optimal match % AND other options with respective percents
- Once suggested match is made, link a build price (newEgg link) with a cost and expected return (staking rewards API)
- Make it PRETTY :)
